🖤 Blackout

Blackout adds a simple command — /blackout — that toggles a full‑screen black overlay. I like to use it with WIM for roleplaying in busy areas.

Use it for roleplay, immersion scenes, cinematic effects, or whenever you want the rest of your screen hidden.

Full‑screen black overlay at Medium frame strata
Fully click‑through and won’t block other UI elements
Remembers its state between sessions
Lightweight, zero dependencies
